# Analyzing-Solar-Cycle-Variability-Using-Sunspot-Data.
Solar cycles are ~11-year patterns of sunspot activity that affect space weather. This project analyzes sunspot data to detect peaks and troughs, measure cycle durations, and explore trends, confirming known patterns and natural variations in solar behavior.
